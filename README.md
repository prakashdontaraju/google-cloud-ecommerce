## Business Case

Our customer (company) from the ecommerce space decided to move its data processing, storage and analytics workloads to the Google Cloud Platform as part of their goal to provide their customers (end user) a better experience.

(I finished the successful implementation of this project. I'm now working on documentation in the sections that follow as well as sharing my learnings and Google Cloud Platform expertise through my [blog.](https://medium.com/@wittygrit))

### Focus

I successfully engineered streaming & batch data processing pipelines on the Google Cloud Platform. I created the infrastructure and peformed customer behavior analysis.

## Data

Include e-commerce details from Kaggle with link. Data is well structured, formatted and hence requires minimal cleaning. T chose this because my focus was on successfully constructing the pipeline and not cleaning data. I still do a little pre-processing of data. Real life data requires a lot of pre-processing.

### Properties of data

Provide explanation of columns, Repetitions, Transformations, Duration of data, creating a data sample.

## Streaming Pipeline Implementation

Detail: Stream data processing, thought process in having simulation and sending sets of streams (sending 1 message in a chunk at once), tools chosen, reasons behind selections, challenges during implementation, few aspects of customer behavior (analysis findings), how the finding helps company improve end customer experience

## Batch Pipeline Implementation

Detail: Batch data processing, thought process in selecting pyspark for batch data processing, tools chosen, alternative without pyspark-dataproc if with just python, reasons behind selections, challenges during implementation, few other aspects of customer behavior (analysis findings), how the finding helps company improve end customer experience

## Deployment

Mention Instructions to implement the 2 pipelines with the files readily available 

## How To Improve End Customer Experience Even Further

can look for other findings - but focused on successfully constructing pipelines and not on deep diving into analytics, can add machine learning workloads to existing data to further refine the company's end customer experience
