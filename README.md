## Business Case

A company from the ecommerce space decides to move its data processing, storage and analytics workloads to the Google Cloud Platform as part of its goal to provide its customers a better experience.

### Focus

I engineer streaming & batch data processing pipelines on the Google Cloud Platform. I create the infrastructure and peform customer behavior analysis.

(I finished the programming part of my project. I'm now working on GitHub documentation as well as sharing my learnings and Google Cloud Platform expertise through my [blog](https://bit.ly/PrakashDontarajuMedium))

## Data

Company name, Kaggle as source, link. Data does not reflect real life data. It's well structured, formatted and hence requires minimal cleaning. Focus is on constructing the pipeline.

### Properties of data

Explanation of columns, Repetitions, Transformations, Duration of data, creating a sample.

## Streaming Pipeline Implementation

Stream data processing, thought process in having simulation and sending sets of streams (sending 1 message in a chunk at once), tools chosen, reasons behind selections, challenges during implementation, 1 aspect of customer behavior (finding), how finding helps company improve end customer experience

## Batch Pipeline Implementation

Batch data processing, thought process in selecting pyspark for batch data processing, tools chosen, alternative without pyspark-dataproc if with just python, reasons behind selections, challenges during implementation, another aspect of customer behavior (finding), how finding helps company improve end customer experience

## How To Improve End Customer Experience Even Further

other findings - but focus on constructing pipelines and not on deep diving into analytics, add machine learning workloads to existing data to further refine the company's end customer experience
