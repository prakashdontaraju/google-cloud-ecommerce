# Customer Behavior Analysis of eCommerce Store on the Google Cloud Platform
I build Streaming & Batch Data Pipelines on the Google Cloud Platform and Docker respectively to perform customer behavior analysis.

(I finished the programming part of my project. I'm now working on code readability, GitHub documentation as well as sharing my learnings and Google Cloud Platform expertise through my [blog](https://bit.ly/PrakashDontarajuMedium))

# Introduction & Goals
I build the following 2 data pipelines:
- Streaming Pipeline on Google Cloud Platform:
  - Compute Engine
  - Cloud Pub/Sub
  - Apache Beam
  - Cloud Dataflow
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - BigQuery
  - Tableau

- Batch Processing Pipeline entirely on Docker:
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - Apache Spark (PySpark)
  - Cassandra
  - Redis
  - MySQL
  - Grafana
