# Customer Behavior Analysis of eCommerce Store on the Google Cloud Platform
I build Streaming & Batch Data Pipelines on the Google Cloud Platform and Docker respectively to perform customer behavior analysis.

(I finished the project. I'm now working on code readability, GitHub documentation as well as writing articles to share my learnings and Google Cloud Platform expertise through my [blog](https://bit.ly/PrakashDontarajuMedium) as you read this. I'm going to publish all my articles and link them to this page by the end of October 2020 while I serve my customers working full time!)

# Introduction & Goals
I build the following 2 data pipelines:
- Streaming Pipeline on Google Cloud Platform:
  - Compute Engine
  - Cloud Pub/Sub
  - Apache Beam
  - Cloud Dataflow
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - BigQuery
  - Tableau

- Batch Processing Pipeline entirely on Docker:
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - Apache Spark (PySpark)
  - Cassandra
  - Redis
  - MySQL
  - Grafana
